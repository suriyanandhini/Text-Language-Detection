📝 Text Language Detection
This project is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that can detect the language of a given text input. It uses machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and a classification model (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression) to classify text into different languages.

🚀 Features
Detects the language of a given text input

Supports multiple languages (English, French, Spanish, Hindi, etc.)

Beginner-friendly implementation in Python

Interactive: user can enter text and get instant predictions

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn (for ML model & vectorization)

Numpy / Pandas (for data handling)
